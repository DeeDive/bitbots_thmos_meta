Documentation
-------------

Our documentation is WIP but what is already available is hosted on [doku.bit-bots.de](http://doku.bit-bots.de/meta/)

You can also build the documentation yourself
``` bash
make doc
```

and open it with

``` bash
firefox doc/html/index.html
```

You can also generate an overview of the software using the script in the architecture folder.
